    "1. Improved performance:-Multithreading can improve the performance of a program by allowing it to perform multiple tasks simultaneously, \n",
    "                      thereby utilizing the available system resources efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Responsiveness:- Multithreading can improve the responsiveness of a program by allowing it to handle multiple tasks concurrently,\n",
    "                   such as accepting user input while processing data in the background.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Resource sharing:- Multithreading allows multiple threads to share the same resources, such as memory or database connections, \n",
    "                   which can reduce the overall resource usage and improve the program's scalability.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Modularity:- Multithreading can help to modularize a program's functionality by separating tasks into different threads,\n",
    "             making it easier to manage and maintain the program's code.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "#Disadvantages:-#\n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "1. Complexity:- Multithreaded programs can be more complex and difficult to design, implement, and debug than single-threaded programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Increased debugging difficulty:- Debugging multithreaded programs can be more difficult due to the potential for race conditions, deadlocks,\n",
    "                                   and other concurrency issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Synchronization and concurrency issues:- Multithreaded programs require careful synchronization of access to shared resources to avoid issues \n",
    "                                        such as data corruption and inconsistency.\n",

    "Ans:-\n",
    "Deadlocks and race conditions are common problems that can occur in multithreaded Python programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Deadlocks occur when two or more threads are blocked and waiting for each other to release resources that they hold. \n",

    "thread is waiting for the resource that is held by another thread.\n",

    "Race conditions occur when two or more threads access shared data concurrently and the final outcome depends on the order\n",
    "in which the threads execute. Race conditions can cause unpredictable behavior in a program, such as data corruption or inconsistency.\n",
    "\n",
    "To avoid deadlocks in Python, it is important to ensure that threads acquire locks on resources in a consistent order and\n",
    "release them in the reverse order. To avoid race conditions, it is important to use proper synchronization mechanisms, \n",
    "such as locks or semaphores, to ensure that only one thread can access shared data at a time.\n",
